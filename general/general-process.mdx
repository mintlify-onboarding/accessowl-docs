title: How does AccessOwl work?
---

AccessOwl is a Slack app to request predefined applications easily, document its approvals and manage the overall accesses of your users. Moreover it finally automates your onboarding and offboarding processes.

The admin or the admin team (multiple users can be defined as “admin”) provides a catalog of requestable application using an easy-to-use web application. Whenever a new application access needs to be provided or an access needs to be revoked a notification is sent to the responsible admin team (application admin). You can define different application admins per application.

AccessOwl coordinates automatically between multiple application admins. That means all of the admins get the request that an access needs to be provisioned. As soon as one of the groups picks that task, the other ones automatically see that they don’t need to act anymore.

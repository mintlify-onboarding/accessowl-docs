## What is an Access Review?

An Access Review is a recurring review of accesses within an organization. These reviews take place to ensure that only employees have access to applications that are still relevant to their work. Usually line managers are asked to review all of their direct reports accesses. The goal is to either

A) Confirm the access, including the role/permission level.
B) Update the role/permission level.
C) Revoke the entire access to the application.

## How does an Access Review with AccessOwl work?

1. Open the Access Review and start with an application of your choice (drop down list)
2. For each user either…

- _confirm the access_: If the user still works with the tool and needs the same role/permissions.
- _update the access_: If the user works with the tool but a different role/permission is needed. For this just click on the edit-symbol next to the role/permission.
- _revoke the access_: If the user doesn’t work with the tool anymore.

3. After finishing reviewing an application simply click on _Submit_ and go to the next application.
   After submitting a reviewed application the respective application admins are informed in case there are any changes to be made.

## Why are Access Reviews important?

To ensure that users don’t have access to data they don’t need, it is necessary to review accesses over time. For many organizations these reviews are mandatory when being certified for certain security certifications, such as SOC-2, ISO 27001, HIPAA etc.

title: Requesting an access on-demand
---

Accesses can be requested by users on-demand using a **global shortcut** or a **button on the Home tab** of the AccessOwl Slack app.

It works like this:

1. With the first request only: The user is asked who her manager is.
2. Every request needs to be approved by the userâ€™s manager.
3. After approval provisioning requests are sent to the responsible application admins (see [General Process](/general-process/)) with all the details.

Access requests can be denied by the manager. However, the User is kept up-to-date via Slack messages about the approval status.

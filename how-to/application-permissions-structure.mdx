title: Application Permission Structure
---

AccessOwl supports three different possiblities to map out an application permission structure, which build on each other.

## 1. One set of Roles/Permissions per application

This is the easiest form. The application has a set of Roles/Permissions (Entitlements). You can specify whether…

- only entitlement can be selected, or
- multiple roles can be selected.

For instance, when somebody can assume only one role in an application, the first option is the right one.

## 2. Several sets of Roles/Permissions per application by adding an object layer

To convert an application from **1** to **2**, click on the blue button top right of the Roles/Permissions box.

This way, you can add another layer between application and Roles/Permissions. Imagine you have an application that has Roles/Permissions on an Account-level (Object) and a Project-level. You could create two objects in this case, each with a different set of Roles/Permissions.

## 3. Multi-level objects with sets of Roles/Permissions per application

To convert an application from **2** to **3** you need at least two objects. Then you can just indent the lower object by clicking on the blue button with right arrow.

Indenting an object means grouping objects together. Imagine you have a bunch of repositories that share the same Roles/Permissions. A parent object holds the right set of entitlements while the child objects inherit them. Mark the parent object “Repositories” as non-requestable as you only want that specific respositories can be requested.

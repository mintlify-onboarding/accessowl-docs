title: Access Templates for simplifying onboarding using roles
---

Access Templates are templates for a specific job role. It’s used in the [Onboarding Flow](/onboarding/) to preselect applications and entitlements. Use it for groups of people like _Marketing Managers_ or _Software Engineers_. The nice thing is that it’s really just a template. You can adjust your access selection afterwards without any dependency on the template. That makes it way more flexible than tradional roles.

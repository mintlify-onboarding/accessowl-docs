title: Onboard new users
---

Onboard new users and provide them the right set of application by using a **global shortcut**.

1. HR Manager triggers onboarding via **global shortcut** and sets business email address of new hire (new hire isnâ€™t on Slack yet) and her manager.
2. Manager gets a message to set initial set of applications for new hire.
3. Manager sets applications and its entitlements for new hire (Hint: use [Access Templates](/access-templates/)).
4. The responsible application admins are notified (see [General Process](/general-process/)) with all the selected accesses.
5. HR Manager gets information that manager selected necessary accesses for new hire.

In addition to that, AccessOwl Admins can trigger an Onboarding using the **Onboarding** button on the Slack home tab.

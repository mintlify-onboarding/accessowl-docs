There are several types of integrations:

## Sync

AccessOwl syncs periodically the roles/permissions schema of an application including a list of users with their role/permission assigned.

## Provisioning

AccessOwl creates or removes user accounts with the specified role/permission of access request or access revocation.

## Directory

AccessOwl syncs (creates or removes/deactivates) users from directories like Slack or Google with the AccessOwl users database.

## Access Review Evidence

AccessOwl uploads access control evidence to an compliance vendor like [Vanta](/supported-integrations/vanta/).

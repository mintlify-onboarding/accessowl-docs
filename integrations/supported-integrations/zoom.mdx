## Usage

We sync periodically user account data from Zoom. Furthermore we provide provisioning/deprovisioning capabilities that are integrated into AccessOwl. You don’t need to configure something in the Zoom integration!

## Remove the app

1. Simply find the Zoom application in the applications list in AccessOwl.
2. Click on the edit icon.
3. Click on “Delete Application”.

This will disconnect AccessOwl from Zoom and delete the application. AccessOwl will not be able to sync data or provision/deprovisiong accounts. Synced data remains so that you still have the overview who has/had access to what. If you want us to remove this data completely [contact us](https://www.accessowl.io/contact/). Anyway, when you delete your AccessOwl account we will remove ALL the data as described in our privacy policy.

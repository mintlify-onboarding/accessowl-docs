We support several features in Google Workspace, e.g. user management, group management etc. More interesting is that we can discover informations like which applications are used by which user automatically for you.

## App Discovery

We analyze usage data in Google Workspace to analyze which applications are used in your organizations. The permissions are granted by an Google Workspace admin on AccessOwl setup.

## User Discovery

Based on emails, we can discover which user uses which application. We only use _readonly_ scopes. We donâ€™t read or download your email. Instead we query specifically for vendor emails.
